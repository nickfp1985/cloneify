Cloneify is a music streaming site, a close Spotify clone, complete with:

- User registration
- Search for all their favorite artists, albums and songs in real time!
- Create and customize their own playlists
- Control the music with all the usual controls such as play, pause, skip, previous, shuffle, repeat etc.

I built this project to practice and master important areas of web development; JavaScript, PHP, HTML and MySQL.
These essential skills are important for any web development project.
